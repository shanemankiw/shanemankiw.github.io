### At First

As a part-time user, I am aware that SMPL (A Skinned Multi-Person Linear Model) is an effective parametric model that can describe the shape of a skinned human with relatively small parameters. It was first published in [2015](https://files.is.tue.mpg.de/black/papers/SMPL2015.pdf), and there have been many extensions to it since. 

However, as I was working on human rendering, it became essential for me to have a fundamental understanding of how it works: how we can build a posed human mesh with a unique shape from a template mesh, what steps are involved, and most importantly, how this process differs from character animation in 3D software like Maya or Blender. These are the topics we will be discussing here.

BTW, I just found a very complete link on SMPL models ([Meshcapade Wiki](https://meshcapade.wiki/SMPL)). It seems very informative and complete, and I think it could come in handy when I need to check something or refresh my memory.

### SMPL Basics

Before getting into all the fancy SMPL-X, SMPL-H, SMAL... We do need to understand what could the basic SMPL model offer. According to the original paper, the most important equation is this:

So according to this figure, 4 steps are taken. And Let's take it step by step.

#### Step1. Template Mesh & Blending Weights

The mesh template and the blending weight can be seen as $\overline{\mathbf{T}}$ and $\mathcal{W}$, respectively.
