## Hello World
Let's test code snippet:

{% highlight python %}
def hello_world():
  print('Hello World Everyone!')
  return
{% endhighlight %}

then a bit math:

$$
\Phi + \Theta = \Pi
$$

Then I want to try code snippet in Typora, see if this works:

```python
def typora():
    print('nice but expensive')
    return
```

OK, how about some image as asset:

Been listening to a lot of Bowie recently... Anyway, it seems like the website is ready to roll.

## Why starting this Blog?
### Enunciate&Sparks of Human Mind

With the recent development in LLM and AI, we witnessed the power of ChatGPT. I have been thinking about it, and I recently read this [article](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ai-chatbots-naive-idiots-no-sense-of-irony-by-slavoj-zizek-2023-03) by Zizek, which mentions that **truth somehow emerges from enunciation**, and we sometimes **prise** a thought and feel **surprise**.

I've been talking to myself my whole life, others find it odd, but productive thoughts often came out of talking my thoughts out, aka. enunciate. Sometimes I talk to myself to complete a messy thought. ChatGPT on the other hand, focuses on accurately paraphrase all ideas and knowledges as is, thus the subtle sparks of human mind can never be replicated.

### Big Models' Emergence

However, the emergence phenomenon has shown in large model training! I came across this emergence while finetuning stable diffusion models myself: the model does not converge at first, but after it sees even more data, it suddenly finds a direction and emerges. 



I do think this is somewhat similar to how the world works: with a complex enough system, there will be magical things happening (such as the origin of life). This has been studied by scholars in the field of [Complex Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system), which I would not continue to discuss and pretend I am an expert.

### And thus...

Besides the fact that I could write a lot faster and better with ChatGPT, I try to write blogs to clear my thought, to understand things more concretely, and of course to keep somewhat a diary of what I do, what I think in a both formal and fun way.
