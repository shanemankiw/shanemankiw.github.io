Let's test code snippet:

{% highlight python %}
def hello_world():
  print('Hello World Everyone!')
  return
{% endhighlight %}

then a bit math:

$$
\Phi + \Theta = \Pi
$$

Then I want to try code snippet in Typora, see if this works:

```python
def typora():
    print('nice but expensive')
    return
```

OK, how about some image as asset:

Seems like the website is ready to roll.
